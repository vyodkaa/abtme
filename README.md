hello there, im vyodka, ure probably reading this because u clicked on me on ponytown, i assume. (there's no way someone would look at my profile otherwise)

im a bit nervous to talk to people first but, if you want to talk to me first go ahead! don't be afraid to open up to me, i tolerate every ship.

though please do not interact with me if u:
- are homophobic, racist, etc. (the usual criteria)
- want to talk about nsfw, gore, or any other disturbing stuff.
- want to argue with me

  other than those, its totally fine to talk to me!

please know, i only like russia/ussr and america for their people and their culture (and because of countryhumans), not the government. i do not support them in any way in political matters.

i do like talking about history and war, i also like military stuff, and i like aviation. 

please int if:
- u have common likings!
- u ship:
  RusAme, GerPol, FrUK, or SovAme
- u tolerate my ships
- u are Russian (i really like Russia and i want to know more about it! i am not a freak)
- u have ocs and have AUS related to countryhumans

thats all for now, thank you!
